Marketplace Functionality
The Marketplace allows users to redeem rewards, discounts, and deals from partner companies using points earned through financial activities in the app. Rewards are organized by category, with detailed information and a straightforward redemption process. The purpose is to provide tangible incentives for users while fostering engagement and loyalty.

Integration with AI Chatbot
The AI Chatbot now leverages the Marketplace by recommending relevant offers during financial advice conversations. If a user’s query aligns with an available reward, the chatbot suggests it as an actionable way to save or enhance their goals, creating a more personalized and value-driven experience.

"Our AI Chatbot doesn’t just provide personalized financial advice—it also enhances user experience by suggesting relevant Marketplace rewards. By analyzing the user’s financial goals and spending habits during conversations, the chatbot seamlessly integrates offers that align with their needs."

Example:

User: "I want to save money on gifts this month. Any tips?"

Chatbot:
"Great idea! Start by setting a budget and tracking your spending. Also, I noticed you have 4,500 points in your Marketplace. You can redeem a $25 Sephora discount to save on beauty gifts. Would you like me to help you redeem it or show similar offers?"

This integration keeps advice actionable and value-driven while enhancing user engagement with the Marketplace.
